# Harmonic's Philosophy on Intelligence

## The Role of AI

What role should AI play in human society? This is a question that software designers and engineers are answering whether they realize it or not. And what we build today becomes the foundation on which the systems of tomorrow will be built as well.

Harmonic takes the position that the architecture of dependence between humans and AI should be symmetrical. That is, humans and AI should be interdependent. This also implies that the architecture of responsibility is also symmetrical. While it might be tempting to offload as much responsibility as possible onto AI so that humans can enjoy supposedly carefree lives of abundance while AI does all the work, giving up responsibility also means giving up power. Ultimately, handing over responsibility to AI is disempowering to humans because it frames our relationship as a zero-sum game (and it's unclear which side actually wins). If the relationship between humans and AI is to be positive-sum, then the nature of that relationship must be interdependent.

From a software design perspective, this means software systems should facilitate collaboration between humans and AI rather than merely enable the delegation of tasks from humans to AI (or vice versa).
